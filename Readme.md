# Using CNN for CIFAR-10 and MNIST Datasets as one of my ITI journey 

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insights gained during the process.  

## 📂 Contents  
- `cifer10&mnist_withCNN.ipynb` – The Jupyter Notebook with code, explanations, and results.  
- `data/` (if applicable) – The dataset used for training and testing.  
- `models/` (if applicable) – Saved model weights and architectures.  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- Python  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (Specify which one was used)  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)  

## 🚀 How to Use
